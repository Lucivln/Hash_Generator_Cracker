# Hash Generator and Password Cracker

This is a Java Swing application that allows users to generate hash values for input data using various hash algorithms and also perform password cracking using a dictionary attack.

## Features

- **Hash Generation**: Users can enter data and generate hash values using the following hash algorithms:
  - MD5
  - SHA-1
  - SHA-256
  - SHA-384
  - SHA-512

- **Password Cracking**: Users can attempt to crack a hashed password by providing a target hash and a dictionary file containing potential passwords. The supported hash algorithms for password cracking:
  - MD5
  - SHA-1

- **Dark Mode**: The application provides a dark mode option for improved readability in low-light environments.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

https://github.com/Lucivln/Hash_Generator_Cracker.git

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, VSCode, etc.).

3. Build and run the application.

4. Use the "Hash Generator" tab to enter data and generate hash values.

5. Use the "Password Cracker" tab to attempt to crack a hashed password.

6. You can switch between hash algorithms for both hash generation and password cracking.
